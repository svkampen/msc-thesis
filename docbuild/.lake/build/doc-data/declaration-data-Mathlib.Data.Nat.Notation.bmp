It is defined as an\ninductive type freely generated by \"zero is a natural number\" and\n\"the successor of a natural number is a natural number\".\n\nYou can prove a theorem `P n` about `n : Nat` by `induction n`, which will\nexpect a proof of the theorem for `P 0`, and a proof of `P (succ i)` assuming\na proof of `P i`. The same method also works to define functions by recursion\non natural numbers: induction and recursion are two expressions of the same\noperation from Lean's point of view.\n\n```\nopen Nat\nexample (n : Nat) : n < succ n := by\n  induction n with\n  | zero =>\n    show 0 < 1\n    decide\n  | succ i ih => -- ih : i < succ i\n    show succ i < succ (succ i)\n    exact Nat.succ_lt_succ ih\n```\n\nThis type is special-cased by both the kernel and the compiler:\n* The type of expressions contains \"`Nat` literals\" as a primitive constructor,\n  and the kernel knows how to reduce zero/succ expressions to nat literals.\n* If implemented naively, this type would represent a numeral `n` in unary as a\n  linked list with `n` links, which is horribly inefficient. Instead, the\n  runtime itself has a special representation for `Nat` which stores numbers up\n  to 2^63 directly and larger numbers use an arbitrary precision \"bignum\"\n  library (usually [GMP](https://gmplib.org/)).\n"},"header":"<div class=\"decl_header\"><span class=\"decl_kind\">def</span>\n<span class=\"decl_name\"><a class=\"break_within\" href=\"./Mathlib/Data/Nat/Notation.html#termℕ\"><span class=\"name\">termℕ</span></a></span><span class=\"decl_args\"> :</span><div class=\"decl_type\"><a href=\"./Init/Prelude.html#Lean.ParserDescr\">Lean.ParserDescr</a></div></div>"}]}
